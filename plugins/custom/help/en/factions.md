# Factions
This command lets you record your character's factions, which will appear in your `profile`. It is a freeform field, so you can list multiple factions. Try to follow the faction naming scheme in `listfactions`, so you show up properly in the rosters.

`factions <list of factions>` - Sets your factions.
`factions` - Clear your factions.

# Listfactions
This command lets you view the list of coded factions on CDMUSH.
So long as the name of the faction appears in your list of factions (set with `factions`), you should be counted on the roster.
Each of the coded factions has an associated channel and board -- if you do not have the access that you should, contact staff.

`listfactions` - Lists factions on the game.
`listfactions <faction name>` - List the roster of a faction.
